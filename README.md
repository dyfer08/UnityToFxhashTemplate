# UnityToFxhashTemplate
This is a basic Unity setup to export fxhash compatible WebGL projects

## Save Manager
An easy to use encrypted game save manager. Create, load, save game data on any platform. It's using a SHA256 encryption and warns you if the game save has been modified or the SHA key is missing so you can decide what to do. You can create as many game save as you want by passing a slot int.

**Quick start** :
1. Clone and open the project.
2. Go to File -> Build Settings and select the WebGL platform.
3. Click on Build And Run to export a test project.
4. Select the 4 exported files and folders (Build, index.html, logo.png, TemplateData) and create a zip file.
5. Go to https://www.fxhash.xyz/sandbox and upload the zip file to test.

**How to use** :

In the Scripts folder you will find a SeedManager.cs. This script contains all the useful functions. It automatically switch between Editor and Build to return either test values or the actual fxhash values when available.

- Get the current hash/seed generated by fxhash as a string. Returns null in Editor :
  ```csharp
  string GetFxhash();
  ```
   
- Get a deterministic random float :
  ```csharp
  float GetFxrand();
  ```  
  
- Check if fxhash preview mode is active :
  ```csharp
  bool GetIsFxpreview();
  ```
  
- Manually trigger the Fxpreview function to generate a preview :
  ```csharp
  TriggerFxpreview();
  ```
  
- As of today it seems there is no way to create the features in Unity and send them to fxhash. The way to go is to set your features in the index.html file. As a reference you'll find a "Sample color" test feature in the index.html file. You can then get the feature value in Unity :
  ```csharp
  string GetFxfeature(string featureName);
  ```
  To do your testings in Editor, you'll find a solution at the bottom of the SeedManager.cs script. You can manually fill arrays to mimick the list of features in your index.html file.
  
- Take a supersized screenshot and automatically download as a PNG. It only works in live mode !
  ```csharp
  IEnumerator CaptureFrame(int superSize);
  ```
